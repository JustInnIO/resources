.SYNOPSIS
    Migrates mail enabled groups from on-premises to Exchange Online
.DESCRIPTION
    The script migrates mail enabled groups from on-premises to Exchange Online by disabling the AD Sync, creating the group in Exchange Online and adding the members to the group. The script exports the groups to a CSV file and disables the AD Sync. After the AD Sync is disabled, the script starts a sync cycle with Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta. After the sync cycle, the script creates the groups in Exchange Online and adds the members to the group. The script also adds additional email addresses that are not the primarysmtpaddress to the group.
    If the export to CSV does not work, the script stops. The script also logs if the AD Sync was disabled, if the group was created in Exchange Online and if the additional email addresses were added to the group.
    The script is used to migrate mail enabled groups from on-premises to Exchange Online.
